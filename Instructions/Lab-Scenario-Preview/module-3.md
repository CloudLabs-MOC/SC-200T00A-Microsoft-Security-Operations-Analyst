## Lab 04: Enabling Continuous Integration with Azure Pipelines

### Lab overview

In this lab, you will learn how to configure continuous integration (CI) and continuous deployment (CD) for your applications using Build and Release in Azure Pipelines. This scriptable CI/CD system is both web-based and cross-platform, while also providing a modern interface for visualizing sophisticated workflows. Although we wonâ€™t demonstrate all of the cross-platform possibilities in this lab, it is important to point out that you can also build for iOS, Android, Java (using Ant, Maven, or Gradle) and Linux.

### Objectives

After you complete this lab, you will be able to:

-   Create a basic build pipeline from a template
-   Track and review a build
-   Invoke a continuous integration build
