# Module 6 - Lab 1 - Exercise 1 - Connect data to Microsoft Sentinel using data connectors

## Lab scenario


You are a Security Operations Analyst working at a company that implemented Microsoft Sentinel. You must learn how to connect log data from the many data sources in your organization. The organization has data from Microsoft 365, Microsoft 365 Defender, Azure resources, non-azure virtual machines, and network appliances.

You plan on using the Microsoft Sentinel data connectors to integrate the log data from various sources. You need to write a connector plan for management that maps each of the organization's data sources to the proper Microsoft Sentinel data connector.

## Lab objective

After completing this lab, you will be able to integrate log data from various data sources within the organization into Microsoft Sentinel using appropriate data connectors.

## Estimated time: 30 minutes
